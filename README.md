# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

> To refactor the stock analysis function in excel VBA to make it faster and able to run for any year in case we have several years of data with thousands of rows of stock data

## Results

> Looking at the 2018 and the 2017 analyses we can see that they ran much faster than it did in the old code, which kept running at around .8 as opposed to the < .1 per second or the current code.
